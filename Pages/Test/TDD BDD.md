# TDD / BDD

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

TDD and BDD are software development methodologies that emphasize writing tests before writing the actual production code.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** TDD is a practice where developers write failing unit tests before implementing the corresponding code. The cycle of writing tests, making them pass, and refactoring the code is repeated until the desired functionality is achieved. TDD promotes a modular and testable codebase, encourages good design practices, and provides a safety net for future changes.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** BDD is an extension of TDD that focuses on describing the desired behavior of the system in a language that is understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. BDD tests are written in a more human-readable format, often using tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow, and emphasize collaboration and communication between team members.
