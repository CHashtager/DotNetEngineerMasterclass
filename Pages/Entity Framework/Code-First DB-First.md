# Code-First / DB-First

## Code-First vs Database-First

- **Code-First:** Creating the data model in code and generating the database from it.
- **Database-First:** Creating the data model from an existing database.

### **Code-First**

**Description**: In the Code-First approach, developers start by defining the data model in their application code using classes. These classes are then used to generate the database schema automatically. Migrations can be used to incrementally update the database schema as the data model changes over time.

**Advantages**:

- **Flexibility**: Developers can work within the comfort of their programming environment without switching to database management tools.
- **Version Control**: Changes to the database schema are made through code, making it easier to version control and track changes alongside application code.
- **Agility**: Ideal for agile development environments where changes to the data model are frequent and iterative.

**Scenarios**:

- New projects where the database does not exist yet.
- Projects that require close alignment between the object model and the database model.
- Environments where application-driven development is preferred, and the database schema is considered a by-product of the application code.

### **Database-First**

**Description**: With the Database-First approach, the database schema is created directly in a database using database management tools. Then, the data model in the application code is generated based on the existing database schema. This approach is often used when working with existing databases.

**Advantages**:

- **Direct Control Over Database**: This approach allows for fine-tuned control over the database schema, including optimizations and customizations that might be more complex to achieve through code.
- **Familiarity**: For teams with strong database administration expertise, this approach leverages their knowledge effectively.
- **Stability**: Suited for situations where the database schema is stable or changes infrequently, ensuring that the application data model is consistently synchronized with the database.

**Scenarios**:

- Existing projects with a pre-defined database schema.
- Projects where database design and optimizations are critical and need to be managed directly by experienced database administrators.
- Situations where the database serves as a shared resource across multiple applications, necessitating a database-centric design approach.

### **Choosing Between Code-First and Database-First**

The choice between Code-First and Database-First depends on various factors, including project requirements, team expertise, development workflow, and the need for control over the database schema. Code-First offers a more agile and code-centric approach, ideal for new projects and rapid iterations. Database-First, on the other hand, offers more control and stability for projects with existing databases or where database schema management is a priority.
