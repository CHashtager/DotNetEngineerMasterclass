# Definition

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software design approach focused on modeling complex software systems according to the domain they operate in and the core problems they aim to solve. DDD emphasizes close collaboration between technical experts and domain experts to ensure the software accurately reflects and addresses real-world requirements and challenges.

## Problem-Domain

Understanding and defining the core issues and challenges in the domain. It's about grasping the "what" that needs to be solved or managed without necessarily delving into "how" it will be solved. The problem domain is essentially the set of problems, requirements, and contexts that the software application needs to address.

## Solution-Domain

Creating solutions based on the identified problems in the domain. It is about the "how" – how to design, architect, and implement the software solution that meets the needs of the problem domain.

### **Connecting Problem and Solution Domains in DDD**

DDD emphasizes a strong alignment between the problem domain and the solution domain through the use of a ubiquitous language—a shared language that bridges domain experts and technical team members. This ensures that the software model accurately reflects the complexities and nuances of the business it aims to serve.
