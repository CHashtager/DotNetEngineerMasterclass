# Load Balancing

- Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple service instances for better scalability and availability.
  - Even distribution of requests, preventing overload on specific services.
  - High availability (HA) to ensure uninterrupted service.
    - HA refers to a system's ability to maintain operational status and functionality despite component failures.
- Load balancing can be implemented at various levels (client-side, server-side, API gateway).
  - Replication involves creating redundant instances of services to enhance reliability and performance.
  - Sharding is a database design approach to improve performance by horizontally partitioning data.
  - Horizontal scaling adds more instances of services, while vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of a single instance.
