# Introduction

## Monolith's Downsides and Advantages

- Downsides:
  - Monolithic codebase becomes complex and hard to maintain as the application grows
  - Scaling is challenging as the entire application needs to be scaled
  - Longer release cycles due to the need to build and deploy the entire application
  - Tight coupling between components makes it difficult to adopt new technologies
- Advantages:
  - Simple to develop and deploy initially
  - Cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security) can be centralized
  - No interprocess communication overhead

## Microservices Downsides and Advantages

- Downsides:
  - Increased complexity due to distributed systems challenges (e.g., distributed transactions, service discovery, communication)
  - Operational overhead in managing and monitoring multiple services
  - Potential for data inconsistency and duplication due to decentralized data management
  - Testing and deployment can be more complex
- Advantages:
  - Improved scalability and resilience by scaling individual services independently
  - Better fault isolation and containment of failures
  - Faster release cycles and easier adoption of new technologies
  - Increased agility and flexibility through loose coupling and separation of concerns
