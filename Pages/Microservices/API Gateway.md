# API Gateway

They act as the primary entry point for external clients to access the various services of an application. This centralized approach helps manage and secure the interactions between clients and services efficiently.

## API Gateway Responsibilities

- API gateways (e.g., Kong, Nginx, Ambassador) act as an entry point for external clients.
- Responsibilities include TLS termination, routing (based on criteria like geo-proximity, latency), throttling, and rate limiting.

### **1. TLS Termination**

- **Description**: TLS termination refers to the process where the API gateway handles the TLS (Transport Layer Security) decryption for incoming requests and re-encrypts the responses for the clients. This offloads the encryption and decryption tasks from the backend services.
- **Benefits**: Centralizing TLS termination simplifies certificate management and enhances security by providing a single point for encrypting and decrypting traffic.

### **2. Request Routing**

- **Description**: The API gateway routes incoming requests to the appropriate backend service based on various criteria, such as the request path, host header, or custom routing rules. Advanced gateways can also route based on geo-proximity, latency, and other factors.
- **Benefits**: Enables efficient service discovery and request distribution, facilitating scalability, and high availability of services.

### **3. Load Balancing**

- **Description**: In addition to routing, API gateways often perform load balancing, distributing incoming requests across multiple instances of a service based on load, thereby preventing any single instance from becoming a bottleneck.
- **Benefits**: Enhances the performance and reliability of services by ensuring requests are evenly distributed among available resources.

### **4. Throttling and Rate Limiting**

- **Description**: API gateways enforce throttling and rate limiting policies to control the number of requests a client can make to an API within a given timeframe. This helps protect backend services from overload and abuse.
- **Benefits**: Prevents service outages and degradation by ensuring that resources are used within their capacity limits. It also enables API providers to implement usage policies and potentially offer tiered service levels.

### **5. Authentication and Authorization**

- **Description**: The gateway can handle authentication and authorization of requests before they reach the backend services, ensuring only valid and authorized requests are processed.
- **Benefits**: Centralizes security policies, reducing the complexity and duplication of authentication mechanisms across services.

### **6. API Versioning and Management**

- **Description**: API gateways facilitate the management of different API versions, allowing clients to access multiple versions of services simultaneously. This is useful for gradually phasing out old APIs and introducing new ones.
- **Benefits**: Simplifies version control and allows for smoother transitions and backward compatibility.

### **7. Caching**

- **Description**: To reduce the load on backend services and improve response times, API gateways can cache responses for common requests.
- **Benefits**: Enhances the overall performance of the API by serving frequent requests quickly from the cache, reducing the need to process the same requests repeatedly on the backend.

### **8. Monitoring and Analytics**

- **Description**: API gateways can collect data on API usage, performance metrics, and logs, providing insights into how the APIs are being used and how they are performing.
- **Benefits**: Offers valuable information for troubleshooting, capacity planning, and understanding client behavior.
