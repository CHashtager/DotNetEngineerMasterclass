# Retries

- Retry mechanisms allow for retrying failed operations, providing resiliency against transient failures.
- Retries can be implemented with exponential backoff and jitter to prevent overwhelming systems during outages.

## **Exponential Backoff**

    Exponential backoff is a strategy used to space out retry attempts in a way that the wait time increases exponentially between retries. This approach helps in managing the load on the system and increasing the likelihood of recovery from transient failures over time. The basic idea is to double the wait time after each retry attempt, optionally applying a maximum retry limit or a maximum wait time.

## **Jitter**

    Jitter involves introducing randomness to the retry intervals to prevent synchronized retries across multiple systems or operations. When many clients are trying to recover from a failure simultaneously, they might all retry at the same time if their retry intervals are identical, leading to spikes in demand that can overwhelm the system. By adding jitter, the retry attempts are desynchronized, spreading the load more evenly over time.

## **Implementation Considerations**

- **Limit the Number of Retries**: It's important to set a maximum number of retry attempts to prevent infinite loops in scenarios where the failure cannot be resolved by retries.
- **Sensible Retry Intervals**: Choose initial retry intervals and maximum wait times that make sense for the specific operation and its requirements.
- **Monitor and Log Retries**: Keeping track of retry attempts and their outcomes is crucial for diagnosing issues and understanding the system's behavior under failure conditions.
- **Handle Different Types of Failures Appropriately**: Not all failures are transient or suitable for retries. Implement logic to distinguish between transient failures (where retries make sense) and permanent failures (where retries would not help).

    ```csharp
    // This code attempts an operation that might fail with a transient error, retries with exponential backoff and jitter, and stops after a maximum number of attempts.
    int retries = 0;
    int maxRetries = 5;
    TimeSpan maxBackoff = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(32);
    TimeSpan baseDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);
    Random jitter = new Random();

    while (true)
    {
        try
        {
            // Attempt the operation
            PerformOperation();
            break; // Success, exit loop
        }
        catch (TransientException) // Assume TransientException identifies recoverable failures
        {
            if (++retries > maxRetries) throw; // Exceeded max retries, rethrow
            
            // Calculate backoff interval with jitter
            var backoff = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(Math.Pow(2, retries)) + TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(jitter.Next(0, 1000));
            var delay = TimeSpan.Min(backoff, maxBackoff);
            
            Task.Delay(delay).Wait(); // Wait before retrying
        }
    }
    ```
