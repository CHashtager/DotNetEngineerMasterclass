# Timeouts

Timeouts specify the maximum duration an operation should take before it's considered failed or stuck.

- Timeouts are set for operations to prevent indefinite waiting for responses from unresponsive components.
- After the timeout period, the operation can be retried, failed gracefully, or a fallback can be used.
- **Application:** Timeouts are commonly set for individual operations, like HTTP requests, database queries, or remote procedure calls.
- **Behavior After Timeout:** When the specified timeout duration is exceeded, the system can take several actions:
  - **Retry the operation**, potentially with exponential backoff strategies to avoid overwhelming the target service.
  - **Fail the operation gracefully**, returning an error message or status code that indicates the operation could not be completed.
  - **Fallback to an alternative approach**, such as serving cached data or executing a simpler, more reliable operation that doesnâ€™t depend on the unresponsive component.
