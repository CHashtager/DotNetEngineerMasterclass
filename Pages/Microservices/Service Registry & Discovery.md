# Service Registry & Discovery

- A service registry is a centralized directory that helps in tracking and managing available services in a microservices architecture.
- Consul, Redis, and similar tools are used for service discovery to locate and communicate with microservices.
- Service discovery tools are crucial in dynamic environments where microservices scale dynamically, ensuring effective communication and load balancing.
