# Key Vaults

- Secure storage and management of secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) are essential in microservices environments.
- **Importance of Key Vaults in Microservices**
  - **Security**: Centralizes the management of secrets in a secure way, reducing the risk of exposure in application code or configuration files.
  - **Access Control**: Provides fine-grained access controls, allowing only authorized services or applications to retrieve specific secrets.
  - **Audit Trails**: Offers auditing capabilities to track access to secrets, helping in compliance and security monitoring.
  - **Secrets Rotation**: Facilitates the rotation of secrets, which is a best practice for maintaining security. Automated rotation minimizes the risk associated with static secrets.
  - **Simplification of Secret Management**: Abstracts the complexity of securely storing and managing secrets, providing a simplified interface for applications.
