# Topology

- **Mediator Topology:** Events flow through a central mediator component.
  - **Centralization:** Facilitates the management and monitoring of event flows.
  - **Complexity Management:** While it simplifies some aspects of the architecture, it can become a bottleneck or a single point of failure, increasing the system's complexity.
- **Broker Topology:** Events are published to a broker, and consumers subscribe to events of interest.
  - **Decentralization:** This approach allows for a more distributed system where components communicate directly through the broker without a central mediator.
  - **Scalability and Flexibility:** It offers better scalability and flexibility, as adding new consumers or producers is generally straightforward and does not require changes to other components.
- The choice depends on factors like complexity, scalability, and observability requirements.
  - **Complexity:** For simpler applications, a mediator might suffice, but as complexity grows, the decoupled nature of a broker may be beneficial.
  - **Scalability:** If scalability is a primary concern, the broker topology might be preferred due to its inherent support for distributed systems.
  - **Observability:** Centralized topologies can simplify monitoring and logging but might introduce performance bottlenecks.
