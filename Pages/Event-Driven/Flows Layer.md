# Flows Layer

- **Event Generator:** Starting point, Produces events from various sources (e.g., user actions, system events).
  - **User Actions:** Interactions with a user interface, such as clicks, form submissions, or gestures.
  - **System Events:** Changes in the system's state, such as a completed transaction, an error occurrence, or a scheduled task.
- **Event Channels:** Mechanisms for transmitting events (e.g., message brokers, queues).
  - **Message Brokers:** Middleware that facilitates message exchange between producers and consumers, often providing features like topic-based publishing/subscribing, message queuing, and durable storage.
  - **Event Queues:** Queues that temporarily store events until they are processed by a consumer, ensuring that events are not lost and can be processed asynchronously.
  - **Event Streams:** Continuous sequences of events that can be processed in real-time, often used in scenarios requiring immediate action or analysis.
- **Event Processing:** Components that handle and process events (e.g., filters, transformations, routing).
  - **Filters:** Components that screen events based on certain criteria, passing only those of interest to subsequent stages.
  - **Transformations:** Operations that modify events, such as enriching data, changing formats, or aggregating information.
  - **Routing:** Mechanisms that direct events to appropriate destinations or services based on content, type, or other attributes.
  - **Event Correlation and Analysis:** Advanced processing that involves correlating multiple events, identifying patterns, and making decisions based on complex rules.
- **Event-Driven Downstream Activity:** Final Layer, Actions or reactions triggered by events (e.g., updates, notifications, workflows).
  - **Updates:** Modifying data or state within the system in response to events.
  - **Notifications:** Alerting users or systems about significant events or conditions.
  - **Workflows:** Initiating or advancing business processes based on event occurrences.
  - **Analytics:** Generating insights through the analysis of event data, often feeding into business intelligence systems.
