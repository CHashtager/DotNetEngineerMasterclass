# Models

- **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Model:** Producers publish events, and consumers subscribe to events they are interested in.
- **Event Streaming Model:**
  - **Simple Event Model:** Events are processed individually.
  - **Stream Event Model:** Events are processed as a continuous stream.
  - **Complex Event Model:** Events are correlated and analyzed to detect patterns or conditions.

## **Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) Model**

- **Description**: In the Pub/Sub model, event producers (publishers) emit events without knowledge of who will consume (subscribe to) them. Similarly, event consumers (subscribers) express interest in one or more types of events and react to them as they occur, without knowledge of which publishers produced the events.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time notifications, messaging applications, and scenarios where multiple services need to react to the same set of events independently.

## **Event Streaming Model**

Event streaming involves handling events in real-time as they occur, often leveraging a distributed log or stream processing system. It can be divided into simpler models based on the nature of event processing:

## Simple Event Model

- **Description**: Each event is processed individually, usually as it arrives. The focus is on handling discrete events rather than looking at the event stream as a whole.
- **Use Cases**: Applications where each event can be dealt with in isolation, such as order processing systems where each order is handled separately.

## Stream Event Model

- **Description**: Events are processed as a continuous stream, allowing for operations over windows of time or across a sequence of events. This model is powerful for analyzing trends over time or aggregating information from multiple events.
- **Use Cases**: Real-time analytics, monitoring applications, or any scenario requiring aggregation or analysis of event data over time.

## Complex Event Model

- **Description**: Also known as Complex Event Processing (CEP), this model involves correlating, combining, and analyzing multiple events to detect patterns or specific conditions. It often requires sophisticated logic to infer more significant events or insights from raw event streams.
- **Use Cases**: Fraud detection, network security monitoring, and business process management, where understanding relationships between multiple events is crucial for making decisions.

## **Choosing the Right Model**

Selecting the appropriate event-driven model depends on the specific requirements of your application, such as:

- **Scalability and Performance Needs**: How the system scales and how quickly events must be processed can influence the choice of model.
- **Complexity of Event Processing**: The complexity of the logic required to process or analyze events may necessitate a more sophisticated model.
- **Real-time vs. Batch Processing**: Whether events need to be processed immediately as they occur or can be processed in batches at intervals.
- **Event Source and Nature**: The source of events and whether they are independent or related can determine the most suitable model.
