# NoSQL

## Types of NoSQL Databases

### Graph Database

- Graph databases store data as nodes and relationships (edges) between nodes.
- Examples: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, OrientDB
- Use cases: Social networks, recommendation engines, fraud detection

### Document-Oriented Store

- Document databases store data in semi-structured documents, like JSON or XML.
- Examples: MongoDB, Couchbase, Amazon DocumentDB
- Use cases: Content management systems, user profiles, catalogs

### Object Storage

- Object storage systems store data as objects (files) with metadata.
- Examples: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
- Use cases: Media storage, backup and archiving, big data analytics

### Column-Oriented

- Column-oriented databases store data in columns instead of rows.
- Examples: Apache Cassandra, HBase, Scylla
- Use cases: Time-series data, high-throughput data ingestion, IoT data

### Keyâ€“Value Store

- Key-value stores associate a key with a value, providing simple and fast data access.
- Examples: Redis, Amazon DynamoDB, Apache Ignite
- Use cases: Caching, session management, real-time applications

Each type of NoSQL database has its strengths and use cases. The choice depends on factors such as data structure, scalability requirements, query patterns, and performance needs.

For example, graph databases excel at handling highly connected data with complex relationships, while document databases provide flexibility for semi-structured data. Column-oriented databases are optimized for analytical workloads and time-series data, while key-value stores offer lightning-fast access for simple data models.
