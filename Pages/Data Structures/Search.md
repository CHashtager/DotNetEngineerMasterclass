# Search Algorithms

- **Linear Search:** Brute force search, O(n) time complexity
- **Binary Search:** Efficient search for sorted arrays, O(log n) time complexity
  - O(log n) time complexity and O(log n) space complexity for the recursive implementation, or O(1) space complexity for the iterative implementation.
