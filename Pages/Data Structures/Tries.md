# Tries (Digital, Radix, or Prefix Tree)

Prefix tree, efficient information retrieval operations

- Tries are not binary trees; they are tree-based data structures used for efficient information retrieval operations like prefix search and autocomplete.
- Lookup, insertion, and deletion operations have a time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the word being processed.
- Pre-order traversal is used to print all words, and post-order traversal is used to delete a word.
