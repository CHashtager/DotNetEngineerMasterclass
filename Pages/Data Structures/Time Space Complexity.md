# Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** How the runtime scales with input size
- **Space Complexity:** How the memory usage scales with input size

## Time Complexity

- **O(1)**: Constant time, the algorithm's time complexity does not depend on the input size.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time, the algorithm's time complexity grows logarithmically with the input size.
- **O(n)**: Linear time, the algorithm's time complexity grows linearly with the input size.
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time, the algorithm's time complexity grows as the product of linear and logarithmic factors.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time, the algorithm's time complexity grows quadratically with the input size.
- **O(n^3)**: Cubic time, the algorithm's time complexity grows as a cubic function of the input size.
- **O(n^k)**: Polynomial time, the algorithm's time complexity grows as a polynomial function of the input size.
- **O(a^n)**: Exponential time, the algorithm's time complexity grows exponentially with the input size.
- **O(n!)**: Factorial time, the algorithm's time complexity grows as the factorial of the input size.

## Space Complexity

- The amount of memory or space required by an algorithm or data structure as the input size grows.
