# String Manipulation

- **Count Vowels**: Use a loop to iterate over the string and count vowels, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
- **Reverse**: Iterate from the start, iterate from the end, or use a stack, all resulting in O(n) time complexity.
- **Reverse Words in a Sentence**: Use a stack or iterate from the end of words, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
- **Remove Duplicates**: Use a HashSet to track visited characters, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
- **Most Repeated Character**: Use a HashMap or an array of size 256 (ASCII values) to count character frequencies, resulting in O(n) time complexity.
