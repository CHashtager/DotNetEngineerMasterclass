# Lambda Expressions

- Concise syntax for anonymous methods.
- **Closures and Captured Variables:** Lambda expressions can reference variables from the outer scope in which they are defined. These variables are "captured" by the lambda, allowing the lambda to access and modify them.
- **Expression Trees:** Lambda expressions can be compiled into expression trees, which represent code as a data structure that can be examined, modified, or executed at runtime.
- **Lambda Expressions Versus Local Methods:** Lambda expressions are often compared to local methods. While local methods are named and can be reused within their containing method, lambda expressions are concise and can easily be passed as arguments or used in LINQ queries.
