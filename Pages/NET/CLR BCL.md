# CLR / BCL

## Common Language Runtime

- **Intermediate Language (IL):** The intermediate code produced by the .NET compiler.
  - **Overview:** When you compile a .NET application, the source code is transformed into IL rather than directly into machine code. IL is then compiled into native machine code just before execution.
  - **Purpose:** The use of IL ensures that .NET applications can be platform-independent at the source code level. The actual platform-specific adaptation happens at runtime through JIT compilation.
- **Managed language:** A language that runs on the CLR, providing automatic memory management.
  - **Overview:** A managed language is any programming language that can be compiled into Intermediate Language (IL) and executed by the CLR. Examples include C#, VB.NET, and F#.
  - **Key Features:** Managed languages benefit from the CLR's features such as automatic memory management, type safety, exception handling, and security. This allows developers to focus more on business logic and less on low-level programming concerns.
- **Managed code:** Code that is executed by the CLR, benefiting from its services like garbage collection.
  - **Overview:** Managed code refers to the code that targets the CLR and thus is executed under its management. Managed code benefits from the runtime services provided by the CLR, such as garbage collection, just-in-time compilation, and access to .NET Framework's class libraries.
  - **Advantages:** Writing managed code enables developers to take advantage of the robust, secure, and efficient execution environment provided by the CLR. It simplifies development and reduces the number of bugs related to memory management and type safety.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT):** The process of converting IL to native machine code at runtime.
  - **Process:** Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation is the process of converting the platform-agnostic IL code into native machine code that the computer's processor can execute. This conversion happens on-the-fly, at the application's runtime.
  - **Benefits:** JIT compilation allows .NET applications to run natively on any supported architecture without needing a recompilation of the source code. It optimizes the application for the specific hardware configuration it is running on, potentially enhancing performance.

## Frameworks and Base Class Libraries

- **The Base Class Libraries (BCL):** A set of classes available across all .NET applications.
- **Application framework layers:** Different layers providing specific functionalities.
- **.NET Standard:** A specification that defines a set of APIs to be supported on .NET platforms.
